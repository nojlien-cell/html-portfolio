<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Completed my BSBA - Management at De La Salle - Araneta University and currently learning Full Web Development Course on Udemy to start a new career journey.</p>

<p>I've worked at a Business Process Outsourcing industry for more than 10 years and still looking for what I really want in my life.
  I became interested in web development because of attending a 10 session Java programming. It was really fun learning about it because I was able to understand
  how computer commands works. Hopefully I might be able to find what I'm really interested in to this course. I believe continuous learning will help me grow
  not just in my career but as an individual. Learning something new can help you discover who you are in life.
